A pseudo-randomly generated world filled with rooms and hallways using a seed. Avatar spawns randomly and can move around using WASD and collect coins. There are encounters and teleports in the world. You can quit and save any progress made on the world. Different seeds generate different worlds and you can access a previous world be entering the seed into the "load" section of the menu. The worlds are saved as a text files on your computer and are named as the seed number (123.txt).
